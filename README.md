# ee7examples
Some JAVA EE7 programming examples with non working logic for the not so obvious reasons.

- 1st problem: The decorated BusinessLogic service does NOT get intercepted ?! Who can solve this ?
- 2nd problem: the Inject of 'DifferentLogicImpl' directly into the BackingBean wont work?! You MUST use the interface it implements?
